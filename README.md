# Data Structure and Algorithm

Welcome to my repository, where I am training in Data Structures and Algorithms using JavaScript with a Java-style approach, which is my preferred language. I have created this repository to track my progress and reflect on my journey in the future. My aim is to look back on this repository and see how much I have improved over time and whether I have become better than I was before.
